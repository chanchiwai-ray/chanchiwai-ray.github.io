      - Contributed and created the Validation plugin to MicroStack with the
        team, enabling cloud validation for Sunbeam using tempest without the
        hassle of configuring it.
      - Integrated the Validation plugin with the Observability plugin to
        peridically check and monitor the health of MicroStack with using
        Grafana dashboards and alerts, allowing cloud operators to identify
        issues easily.
      - Worked with the team and rewrote the legacy unmaintained hw-health charm
        into Hardware Observer operator with native integration of COS-lite,
        providing modern solution for monitoring hardware resources on
        bare-metal infrastructure in Juju ecosystem.

      - Contributed and created the Observability plugin to MicroStack (an
        OpenStack distriution also known as Sunbeam) with the team, enabling
        Observability (COS Lite) in MicroStack.
      - Developed a Python-based Prometheus Exporter for Hardware Observer
        Operator (prometheus-hardware-exporter) to provide various collectors
        for vendor dependent RAID devices.

      - Addressed critical bugs in Graylog charm and Elasticsearch charm that
        blocked the testing in solution QA team's testing pipeline.
      - Enhanced legacy apt-mirror charm's code base by introducing unit and
        functional tests, assuring the charm's quality.
      - Introduced a clean up feature to apt-mirror charm that helped reducing
        unused mirrored files, and reduced disk usage in privately managed
        production cloud.
      - Developed a Snap-based Prometheus Exporter
        (prometheus-juju-backup-all-exporter) for Juju Backup All charm, and
        integrated the charm with the Canonical Observability Stack Lite (COS
        Lite).
