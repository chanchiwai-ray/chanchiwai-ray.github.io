## üëã Hello! I'm Ray.

I'm a software engineer üíª with 3 years of experience working on open source cloud technologies such as Juju, OpenStack,
Kubernetes, and Observability Stack (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki). I am experienced in developing Charms, Snaps, Rocks,

our Managed Solution team. During my time at Canonical, I worked on and contributed to many open source projects
including [Sunbeam][sunbeam], [MicroCeph][microceph], [Kafka][Kafka], [Hardware Observer Operator][hardware-observer],
and many others [projects][projects].
