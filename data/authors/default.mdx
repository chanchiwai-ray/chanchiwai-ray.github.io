I am a highly motivated Software Engineer with 3 years of experience specializing in cloud technologies and open-source
contributions.

I am proficient in deploying OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Observability stack (Loki, Grafana, Prometheus) using Juju or
Snap. Experienced in developing and maintaining charms, snaps, and rocks images.  Skilled in both Go and Python
programming languages. Eager to leverage expertise to build and scale robust, observable, and efficient cloud solutions.
