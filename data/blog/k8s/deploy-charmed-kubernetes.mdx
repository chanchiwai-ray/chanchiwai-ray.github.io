draft: false
summary: There many ways to set up Kubernetes cluster for learning purpose, such as minikube or MicroK8s. In this post, I would like to introduce yet another way to deploy Kubernetes cluster with Canoincal K8s.
---

## 🌟 Introduction

Distributions like minikube and MicroK8s are great for setting up a local Kubernetes for testing and learning. If you
need anything more than a testing environment (maybe a cluster for your homelab or a cluster for your small business),
these option may not be great. [Canonical Kubernetes][canonical k8s] is another distribution which can be used to deploy
multi-node Kubernetes cluster on premise or on the cloud, and it offers many [integrations][k8s integration] with other
solutions such as OpenStack and Ceph.

In this post, I am going to show you how to set up a three nodes Kubernetes cluster on you local desktop or laptop for
**testing or learning** purpose. The tutorial uses [LXD][lxd] as the cloud substrate for the nodes, but you can also use
other [cloud substrates][juju clouds] as well.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use it for production! This is not a tutorial for setting up a production grade Kubernetes cluster!

## 🪨 Prerequisite

Before you continue with the tutorial, please make sure that you have met the following software or hardware
requirements. You can follow the link to install and initialize the software required for this tutorial.

- [LXD][lxd]
- [Juju][juju]
- [Terraform][terraform]
- About 6 CPUs (not a strict requirements)
- About 12 GiB of RAMs (not a strict requirements)
- About 100 GiB of storage (not a strict requirements)

These are not a hard requirements. Depending on the workloads, you should still be able to complete the deployment with
a less powerful machine.

> [!NOTE]
> The reason for using Juju and Terraform is for reproducibility. As a testing environment, you may change you setup
> frequently. Using terraform allows you to easily re-deploy the same environment with all the necessary addons.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> [!TIP]
> If you simply want to try out the Kubernetes cluster, you can go to my infrastructure repository:
> https://github.com/chanchiwai-ray/infrastructure/tree/main/deployments/testing-ha/k8s-juju-lxd.

We will be using the [Terraform Juju provider][terraform-juju-provider] to deploy three nodes Kubernetes cluster at
version 1.32. One of the served as both worker and control plane node, the remaining two will be the worker nodes. The
spec of virtual machines are listed below:

- k8s/0
  - 2 vCPUs
  - 4 GiB of RAMs
  - 1 root disk of 20 GiB
- k8s-worker/0
  - 2 vCPUs
  - 4 GiB of RAMs
  - 1 root disk of 40 GiB
- k8s-worker/1
  - 2 vCPUs
  - 4 GiB of RAMs
  - 1 root disk of 40 GiB

### 📑 Terraform plan

The first thing in the terraform plan is the `terraform` block. We will specify the provider as Terraform Juju provider.
Then, we need to create a [Juju model][juju-model] called `k8s` on the cloud `localhost` in `localhost` region.

```terraform
# main.tf

# Use Terraform Juju provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    juju = {
      version = "~> 0.17.0"
      source  = "juju/juju"
    }
  }
}

# Create a Juju model
resource "juju_model" "k8s_model" {
  name = "k8s"

  # In my case, they are both `localhost`.
  # You can check yours using `juju clouds` and `juju regions`.
  cloud {
    name   = "localhost"
    region = "localhost"
  }
}
```

---

Next, we will create one unit of the control plane node (also used as a worker, but you disabled it using `kubectl`
later if required).

```terraform
# main.tf

# ... some content from previous steps

module "k8s" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/canonical/k8s-operator//charms/worker/k8s/terraform?ref=main"

  units = 1 # one control plane node
  model = juju_model.k8s_model.name

  base        = "ubuntu@24.04"
  channel     = "1.32/stable"
  constraints = "arch=amd64 cores=2 mem=4096M root-disk=20480M virt-type=virtual-machine"

  config = {
    load-balancer-enabled = true                        # enable load balancer feature
    load-balancer-cidrs   = "10.42.75.200-10.42.75.200" # load balancer cidrs (placeholder, need update)
    ingress-enabled       = true                        # enable ingress feature
    local-storage-enabled = true                        # enable local hostpath storage
  }
}
```

Here, I am using a module from the upstream to simplify the terraform plan a little bit. For the module options, I set
the version of Kubernetes to `1.32` and specify the constraints for the unit as `arch=amd64 cores=2 mem=4096M
root-disk=20480M virt-type=virtual-machine`. If you want to use a different version of Kubernetes, or want to use less
resources, you can adjust those values. However, note that the constraint for `virt-type=virtual-machine` is
**required**, since the CNI used in Canonical Kubernetes (Cilium) cannot run inside unprivileged containers.

If you are deploying a Kubernetes cluster for learning, it's general nice to have some built-in features such ingress
controller and storage class configured. So, in the `config` block, I enable the load-balancer, ingress, and local
storage features.

---

Next, we will add two units of the worker nodes.

```terraform
# main.tf

# ... some content from previous steps

module "k8s_worker" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/canonical/k8s-operator//charms/worker/terraform?ref=main"

  units = 2 # two worker nodes
  model = juju_model.k8s_model.name

  base        = "ubuntu@24.04"
  channel     = "1.32/stable"
  constraints = "arch=amd64 cores=2 mem=4096M root-disk=40960M virt-type=virtual-machine"

  config = {}
}
```

Here, the module options are pretty much the same as the control plane node, just a bit more storage `root-disk=40960M`
and no extra configuration for the worker nodes.

---

Finally, the control plane node and the worker nodes need to form a cluster. To do that, we can use the [Juju
integration][juju-relation], and it's a resource in Terraform Juju provider.

```terraform
# main.tf

# ... some content from previous steps

resource "juju_integration" "k8s_to_k8s_worker" {
  model = juju_model.k8s_model.name

  application {
    name     = module.k8s.app_name
    endpoint = "k8s-cluster"
  }

  application {
    name     = module.k8s_worker.app_name
    endpoint = "cluster"
  }
}
```

The Juju integration basically are some Python codes that handles the forming (or destruction) of Kubernetes cluster.

### 🤝 Put it all together

Below is the entire terraform plan for deploying three nodes Kubernetes cluster:

```terraform
# main.tf

# Use Terraform Juju provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    juju = {
      version = "~> 0.17.0"
      source  = "juju/juju"
    }
  }
}

# Create a Juju model
resource "juju_model" "k8s_model" {
  name = "k8s"

  # In my case, they are both `localhost`.
  # You can check yours using `juju clouds` and `juju regions`.
  cloud {
    name   = "localhost"
    region = "localhost"
  }
}

module "k8s" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/canonical/k8s-operator//charms/worker/k8s/terraform?ref=main"

  units = 1 # one control plane node
  model = juju_model.k8s_model.name

  base        = "ubuntu@24.04"
  channel     = "1.32/stable"
  constraints = "arch=amd64 cores=2 mem=4096M root-disk=20480M virt-type=virtual-machine"

  config = {
    load-balancer-enabled = true                        # enable load balancer feature
    load-balancer-cidrs   = "10.42.75.200-10.42.75.200" # load balancer cidrs (placeholder, need update)
    ingress-enabled       = true                        # enable ingress feature
    local-storage-enabled = true                        # enable local hostpath storage
  }
}

module "k8s_worker" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/canonical/k8s-operator//charms/worker/terraform?ref=main"

  units = 2 # two worker nodes
  model = juju_model.k8s_model.name

  base        = "ubuntu@24.04"
  channel     = "1.32/stable"
  constraints = "arch=amd64 cores=2 mem=4096M root-disk=40960M virt-type=virtual-machine"

  config = {}
}

resource "juju_integration" "k8s_to_k8s_worker" {
  model = juju_model.k8s_model.name

  application {
    name     = module.k8s.app_name
    endpoint = "k8s-cluster"
  }

  application {
    name     = module.k8s_worker.app_name
    endpoint = "cluster"
  }
}
```

### 💻 Deploy Kubernetes cluster

In the directory with the terraform plan, and run the following commands:

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

This will deploy the kubernetes cluster in the background. To monitor the deployment progress, run

```shell
juju status --watch 5s
```

When the deployment is completed, you should see something like this

```text
Model  Controller  Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
k8s    overlord    localhost/localhost  3.6.3    unsupported  14:35:30+08:00

App         Version  Status  Scale  Charm       Channel      Rev  Exposed  Message

k8s-worker  1.32.2   active      2  k8s-worker  1.32/stable  456  no       Ready

k8s/0*         active    idle   2        10.42.75.196    6443/tcp  Ready

Machine  State    Address       Inst id        Base          AZ  Message
0        started  10.42.75.176  juju-da35cc-0  ubuntu@24.04      Running
1        started  10.42.75.227  juju-da35cc-1  ubuntu@24.04      Running
2        started  10.42.75.196  juju-da35cc-2  ubuntu@24.04      Running
```

I mentioned earlier that the `load-balancer-cidrs` config option was just a placeholder. Now, we will update it the IP
addresses of these nodes (because we don't have external load balancer so we will just use these nodes as "external"
load balancer).

```shell
juju config k8s load-balancer-cidrs="10.42.75.176/32 10.42.75.227/32 10.42.75.196/32"
```

One of the IP will be used by Cilium to create a `cilium-ingress` service of `LoadBalancer` type (remember we enabled
ingress feature), so you will only have two IPs for service of `LoadBalancer` type.

For more information about ingress and load balancer in Canonical Kubernetes, see the
[documentation][canonical-k8s-features].


### 🧙 Manage the Kubernetes cluster

To retrieve the kube config, run

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube/config

if [ -e $HOME/.kube/config ]; then
    mv $HOME/.kube/config $HOME/.kube/config.backup.$(date +%F)
fi

juju run k8s/0 get-kubeconfig | yq -r '.kubeconfig' >> $HOME/.kube/config
```

. The `get-kubeconfig` is an [Juju action][juju-action] defined in the k8s operator that returns the kube config in yaml
format. We need to extract the `kubeconfig` key from the result, and place it in `$HOME/.kube/config`. In case you
previously have the kube config, you can also back it up `mv $HOME/.kube/config $HOME/.kube/config.backup.$(date +%F)`.

You can then use `kubectl` to manage the Kubernetes cluster. If you are on Ubuntu, you can use the `kubectl` snap.

```shell
sudo snap install kubectl --classic
```

Alternatively, you can install `kubectl` following the [official documentation][kubectl].

### 💡 Check the status of Kubernetes cluster

Finally, let's check what is in the Kubernetes cluster.


**Nodes**

```text

```

There are ingress, local rawfile storage, and load balancer features because we enabled them during the
deploymentbecause we enabled them during the deployment.

## 🧹 Clean up resources

When you are done with the testing, run

```shell
terraform apply -destroy
```

to clean up the resources.
