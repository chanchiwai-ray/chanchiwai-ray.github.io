## Introduction

There are other great certification from the Linux Foundation such as CKA, CKAD, or CKS, that can boost your Resume.
LFCS certification is probably **not** one of them since you rarely see people celebrating that they passed LFCS.
Moreover, the certificates from the Linux Foundation is not cheap, most people would probably just purchase the one that
can boost their Resume the most. For me, however, I didn't take the exam (may be not entirely true ...) to boost my
Resume, rather I think of it as a chance to learn Linux because I didn't have any formal training in Linux (I studied
Physics at the University), even though I've been using Ubuntu to do software development for quite some time.

## Preparation

There aren't many good preparation materials that are directly related to the exam itself, most of them are some what
just some general Linux related tutorials or notes (that's fair... after all this is an exam about Linux...). Below
are some materials that I found useful for learning and practicing Linux skills before taking the exam.

Review materials:

- https://github.com/simonesavi/lfcs (topics based on LFCS exam)
- https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/essentials-of-linux-system-administration-lfs201 (great for overview)

Practice questions:
- https://github.com/chanchiwai-ray/lfcs-practice-questions (disclaimer: from me)
- https://killercoda.com/pawelpiwosz/course/linuxFundamentals (fundamental linux course)
- https://killer.sh/lfcs (official simulator from the Linux Foundation, you will have access to it if you purchase the exam)
